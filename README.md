# God Waiting Sound Application
When taking theater in high school, we had to do a play. I was in charge of designing the sounds
The usual setup was Windows Media Player and an external mixer, but this didn't allow for playing multiple sounds and doing smooth transitions like I wanted. Solution: Make a sound application to do that.

This is a very quick solution I made 2 days before our first presentation. It just uses Windows Forms to allow the soundman to switch between scenes, on each scene putting the needed sounds, with some easy controls for the sounds (some automatically changing, allowing for smooth transitions).
UI is a fixed size, everything is very fixed and specific to our play, plus it has some Hebrew which is weird. Still, it's the only project I've ever completed, so I wanted it to be here.
Originally it was so specific that I didn't even use relative paths. I had a constant with the path. When building for my PC to test I used the path for the sounds in Documents, and when building to take with me, I used a relative path specific to how I'll put everything on a hard drive. Before putting this here I decided to make it work on all computers, so it also has the sounds included.

Also, about the name: The name of the play (translated) is "god waiting in the station". So, this is just a sound application for that play
